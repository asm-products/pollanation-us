## Polling Nations with Pollanation.

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/pollanation](https://assembly.com/pollanation).

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.

Pollanation is an open-source polling site that is political in scope and will be written with Ruby on Rails.

Each nation will have it's own corresponding TLD. The source is open and anyone, in any nation will be able to duplicate it and host it on their own.

This repo is being developed for pollanation.us.
